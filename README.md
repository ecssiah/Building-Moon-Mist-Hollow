# Building Moon Mist Hollow

This repo contains the resources for the seezero Building Moon Mist Hollow
Unity game development tutorials.

*The premise:*

You are the ruler of Moon Mist Hollow.

The people have granted you absolute control over the framework of their society,
but they are still in control of their daily lives.

You design the rules by which they live out their lives, and they will respond
accordingly. Eventually, if the people's anger gets intense enough they will join
together and kill you - ending your rule.
