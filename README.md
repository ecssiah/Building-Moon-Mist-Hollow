# Building Moon Mist Hollow

This repo contains the resources for the seezero Building Moon Mist Hollow Unity tutorials.

*The premise...*

Can you rule Moon Mist Hollow? The citizens will attempt to live their lives, and you have to rule them in a way they feel is just - or they will begin to defy your rule.

What does it mean to rule? It means you make the rules. They play the game.

What is a rule?

*No citizen can be on a public street after 10pm.*

*Thieves will be hanged.*

There is a wide range of rules that citizens can be made to live under. They will decide what rules are fair.
